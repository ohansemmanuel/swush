<h1 align="center">Swush</h1>

<p align="center">The missing Bootstrap 4 utility lib.</p>

[//]: # (Include Travis CI badges here)

## Why should you use it?

Having used Bopotstrap 4 for a lot of quick prototyping, I realized I was quickly rewritting so many (extra) utility classes. 
Why stress when I abstract all of that into a tiny effective library? 

Everything you need to work smoothly is here in a **1kb** file (minified + gzipped). On top of that, you don't need to learn specific classes. The class names are consistent with the Bootstrap 4 naming conventions. This makes for an intuitive experience developing with Swush and Bootstrap 4.
