## Why should you use it?

Everything you need to create a basic project is included, all in a **2kb** file (minified + gzipped). On top of that, almost everything is styled automatically, without the need for learning specific classes. This allows for an intuitive experience developing with Wing, as it's designed to be a boilerplate stylesheet for any project.

## Installation

**npm (coming soon)**
